# Spatial Scaffolding for Future of Text / Sloan grant on auhoring in XR, Quarter 1

Building on https://git.benetou.fr/utopiah/text-code-xr-engine this environment aims at authoring academic text in XR, specifically VR first.

You can setup the backend via the Dockerfile. It will spawn a NodeJS server. Note that a working WebDAV server is required and for that https://github.com/bfren/docker-nginx-webdav is recommended.

The data directory includes the frontend with its filters.

The core XR interactions are done via jxr-core.js

See https://futuretextlab.info for discussions, including videos, on the motivation behind this work.
